# Java Anonymous Class Example

This project is a simple demonstration of how to create an anonymous class that implements the `Comparator<T>` interface in Java.

## Project Structure

The project consists of two main files:

- `src/courses/Course.java`: This file contains the `Course` class, which represents a course with a name and a final grade.

- `src/Main.java`: This file contains the `Main` class, which includes a `main` method. In this method, a list of `Course` objects is created and sorted using an anonymous class that implements the `Comparator<T>` interface.

## Running the Project

To run the project, navigate to the `src` directory and run the `Main.java` file.

## Example Output

The program will output a list of courses sorted by their final grade.
